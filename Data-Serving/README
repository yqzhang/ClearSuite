To run the Data-Serving benchmark, you will need one server to provide
the service and one client to issue requests. They could be the same
machine if you do not need to isolate their behaviors. *-server.sh is
supposed to be executed on the server and *-client.sh on client. The steps
are shown below:

 1. Set up the server and the client
   a) setup-server.sh
   b) setup-client.sh
 2. Warm up the server
   a) warmup-client.sh
 3. Start the test
   a) start-client.sh
